Our focus is developing, producing, finance-raising and marketing and freeing quality, thought-provoking, challenging cinema for an international audience.
We are creative producers with real experience of the whole process from script to screen. 

Our objective is to work with filmmakers with talent and vision to create outstanding work, or help great films on their way. We work with both the best new talent as well as great established names.

experience crosses the divide between the development and sales process. Bringing experience from the latter to bear on the former means we can consult at every stage of the development, production, sales and distribution process of a film. We are passionate about cinema and everything that goes into making a film that says something, means something, and deserves to reach a worldwide audience.
